  '<b>NOTICE:</b> There is a <span>20 XRP</span> reserve requirement to activate any XRP wallets. Once an XRP address is funded with the 20 XRP, the activation fee will be locked by the XRP ledger network and is non-refundable and non-recoverable unless the network lowers the reserve requirement. In addition, the user must transfer and maintain at least <span>1 XRP</span> to cover transaction fees for SOLO or other tokenized asset transactions. Transferring SOLO or trading SOLO on the decentralized exchange incurs a transaction fee of 0.01%.<br><br>The 100% of this transaction fee will be burned instantly by being sent to the gatewayâ€™s issuing address. The system practices this deflationary mechanism to bring down the total supply of SOLO coins. This practice makes an equilibrium that in the long term makes it impossible for the SOLO coins to deplete due to higher valuation of coins and lower supply.<br><br><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> SOLOGENIC WALLET IS A DECENTRALIZED AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE WHICH KEEPS YOUR DATA ON YOUR DEVICES.
